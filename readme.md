# Using ScrapingBee to Perform Complicated Scrapes

Proxies as an API are incredibly easy to use. Sometimes when doing more complicated scrapes that include logging in and form submissions, it's easier to just use a standard style proxy. Fortunately, ScrapingBee includes just such a tool!

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and run `npm i`.

You will need a ScrapingBee API key. Get one [here](https://www.scrapingbee.com?fpr=jordan-hansen52).

Update the `.sample.env` file with your API key and rename it to `.env`.

`npm start` to run it.

### Prerequisites

Tested on Node v16.13.2 and NPM v8.1.2

### Installing

After installing [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) you should be able to just run the following in the terminal.

```
npm i
```
